<h1> CryptoZombies Tutorials </h1>

These tutorials can be found on the Cryptozombies webpage: https://cryptozombies.io </br>
These tutorials were assigned by my Blockchain & Applications class. </br>
I am in no way claiming that I created these. I am only following them and learning. This is part one of assignment four. </br>

<h2> :floppy_disk: Installation </h2>
No installation required here. Just head over to the website and complete the tutorials. </br>

<h2> :pencil: Usage </h2>
You just need a browser and a desktop/laptop. I would not recommend doing these on a phone. </br>
